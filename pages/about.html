                            <h2>Visual Design</h2>
                            <p>The target audience I decided to go for was 14 to 16 year olds. I wanted a
                                website that
                                didn't look too childish, while not looking too professional either. This included the
                                active
                                use of colors, larger fonts and elements, and reading material fitting the young
                                teenager
                                demographic. I prioritized making a cohesive design that was playful, e.g. the
                                navigation bar
                                with the hover effect and yellow bulletins. At the same time, it was important to not
                                "dumb it down" too much as they are quite capable of understanding the current struggles
                                connected to climate, and acting as if they aren't would only be a disservice. I went
                                for the
                                font family Arial, due to it's applicability and how readable it is on the screen. It
                                was also
                                necessary to make sure that how the colors communicated with each other followed <abbr
                                    title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</abbr>, to make the website as
                                accessible
                                as possible.</p>

                            <h2>Structure</h2>
                            <p>Structural tags I used within the &lt;body&gt; tag, where &lt;nav&gt; for the navigation
                                bar at the top, &lt;main&gt; for the main content, and &lt;footer&gt; for the footer at
                                the bottom of my website. In addition, I used &lt;section&gt; or &lt;article&gt; (like
                                on my
                                "About" page) where they applied within the &lt;main&gt; tag. When it comes to my folder
                                system,
                                I have one folder called "images" for images, and another called "pages"—that includes
                                all sites besides the home page (landing page, index.html)—below my parent folder. The
                                stylesheet I used is not within any subdirectories. I did it this way to make sure
                                everything was orderely and easy to navigate.</p>

                            <h2>Responsivness</h2>
                            <p>I applied both grid and flexbox to build my website. I am not sure if I created more
                                &lt;div&gt;
                                containers/boxes than necessary, but layout-wise my site ended up looking how I wanted.
                                With media queries, which were (max-width: 600px) and (min-width: 1200px), I increased,
                                reduced or eliminated
                                properties such as padding, margin and gap depending on the need. Combined with the use
                                of responsive
                                units, such as rem and %, my website ends up being quite responsive. It
                                does look functional for the "Galaxy Fold" screen, the smallest definitive screen within
                                the Inspect tool,
                                and the design doesn't start breaking before around 262px width.</p>

                            <h2>Carbon Footprint</h2>
                            <p>To make sure that the carbon footprint of my website is as small as possible, I went
                                through multiple processes. First, I attempted to write efficient code and not repeat
                                myself (DRY-principle) in my CSS. Writing inefficient code and including elements that
                                you won't display on your website only lead to higher energy consumption, as it takes
                                resources from the computer to store and increases the load on a website for example.
                                Another way to reduce the carbon footprint was to change the format of all my images to
                                WebP, a photo format that has around the same file size as JPG while preserving the
                                quality of an image better. Using a converter, I saved about 2.8 MB total. While that's
                                not a
                                lot, doing this on more complex sites will add up. The exceptions are the game board
                                I created with Adobe Illustrator (did use the "save for web" option however), and the
                                Goal 13 logo due to the green color changing after the conversion.
                            </p>

                            <h2>Sources</h2>
                            <p>The source used to make this website has only been UN, both for facts and information and
                                when it comes to images linked to their visual identity. Other images where downloaded
                                from Pixabay, which are royalty-free. I used ChatGPT as a tool to
                                rephrase the text to make it easier to understand for the chosen target group, which was
                                14–16 years old, and for identifying issues when it comes to certain issues within my
                                code.
